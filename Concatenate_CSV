# script to concatenate all CSV files within a directory to combined.csv
# files should have similar 

#import required libraries
import glob
import os
import pandas as pd

#set working directory
os.chdir(r"\\shsdata03a\NSL_MNG\Group strategic development\11 Reporting and Analytics\Bryden\032 SMB Cancellation Churn")

# Use glob to match the pattern ‘csv’
# Match the pattern (‘csv’) and save the list of file names in the ‘all_filenames’ variable. 

extension = 'csv'
all_filenames = [i for i in glob.glob('*.{}'.format(extension))]

# use pandas concat function to read csv files into a pandas dataframe
combined_csv = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f) for f in all_filenames ])

# Above function throws a warning because Pandas is reading mixed dtypes for a column
# We can cast the datatype using the dtype argument, however 
# a) the numeric column # contains comma characters which would need to be stripped out
# b) the data will be used in Tableau where datatypes are more easily detected and changed
# example: combined_csv = pd.concat([pd.read_csv(f, dtype={'Adjustment Amount': 'float64'}) for f in all_filenames ])


#lastly, export the resulting dataframe to csv
combined_csv.to_csv( "combined.csv", index=False, encoding='utf-8-sig')
